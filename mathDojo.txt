Create a Python class called MathDojo that has one attribute, result, and 2 methods: add and subtract. The 2 methods each must take at least 1 parameter, but could take many more.


1 Create a MathDojo class

2 Write the add method and test it by calling it 3 times, with different numbers of arguments each time

3 Write the subtract method and test it by calling it 3 times, with different numbers of arguments each time

4 Make sure you are able to chain methods as demonstrated above
